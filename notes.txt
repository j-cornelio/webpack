webpack-dev-server 
provides you with a simple web server and the ability to use live reloading. Change your config file to tell the dev server where to look for files:

devServer: {
+     contentBase: './dist'
+   },

tells webpack-dev-server to serve the files from the dist directory on localhost:8080.
